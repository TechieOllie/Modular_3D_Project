## Core Components to Implement
1. G-code Parser

    - Parse incoming G-code commands
    - Interpret motion commands (G0, G1, G2, G3, etc.)
    - Handle configuration commands

2. Motion Control System

    - Implement stepper motor control algorithms
    - Create acceleration profiles
    - Manage trajectory planning

3. I/O Management

    - Configure GPIO pins for stepper drivers, limit switches, etc.
    - Set up hardware timers for precise motion control
    - Implement UART/USB for communication

4. State Machine

    - Handle different operational states (idle, running, homing, etc.)
    - Manage error conditions and emergency stops

## Implementation Strategy
1. Port the core GRBL architecture to STM32 environment

2. Leverage STM32's hardware capabilities:

    - Use hardware timers for more precise stepping control
    - Take advantage of DMA for communication
    - Use the higher processing power for better motion planning

3. Start with basic functionality and incrementally add features
